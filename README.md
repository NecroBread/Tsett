*That is my introduction or something like that*

Greetings, everyone who are reading this. My name is **NekiBread** and I'm a russian shitposter, who makes an actually serious mod for Terraria 1.3 (when tModLoader for 1.4 released, I would be porting this mod on it).

So this mod contain 15 items and 2 buffs... and I don't know what to add in this description.
I have some ideas for this mod, and I hope I'll realize them in future.

If you have a questions, please message me in [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NekiBread) or Discord (NekiBread#9289), I'll answer you ASAP.

Also, you'll be able message me on my Discord server when I do a special channel.
